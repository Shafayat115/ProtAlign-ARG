# ProtAlign-ARG
Here we introduce a novel self-supervised hybrid model combining both a pre-trained protein language model and an alignment scoring-based model (ProtAlign-ARG) to identify/classify ARGs.

The Data folder has the dataset processed into train and test sets. You can use the graph part and CDHIT tool to achieve the clustering results.
The ARG_Train.py and ARG_Test.py are the training and testing scripts. You can use Generate_Embedding.py to generate embedding for your train or test set. Use requirements.txt to have the necessary libraries installed. 

The Models and Embeddings folder has the generated models and embeddings for the experiments. You can use these models to further analyze or validate the results.
